    <p>Hello! My name is Jackson Arnold. I am 18 and I go to West Hills College.</p>
    <p>As you can see on the photo on the right, I play guitar. I can play bass and electric, but I'm still learning. My favorite bands as of right now are Avenged Sevenfold, TOOL, and Tame Impala.</p>
    <p>Learning is something that is a necessity in life. Whether it's teaching yourself or being taught by others. I have managed to self teach myself most of my knowledge on my instruments.</p>
    <p>Coding is something I thought I would take no interest in, but here I am. I love it so far, and I'm excited to learn more about it.</p>
